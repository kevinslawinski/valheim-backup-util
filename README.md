* Double-click `run.bat`
* Alternatively, run `python src/main.py` in a terminal
* If you want to use the app via the terminal, run `python src/main.py --cli` instead

## Things to know
* Currently only supports Windows
* You should have Valheim installed already. This was developed & tested with an install via Steam.
